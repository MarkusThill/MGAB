# The Mackey-Glass Anomaly Benchmark
This repository contains a non-trivial synthetic benchmark, named Mackey-Glass anomaly benchmark (MGAB) in the 
following. Mackey-Glass time series are known to exhibit chaotic behavior under certain conditions. MGAB contains 10 MG time series of length $T=10^5$. Into each time series 10 anomalies are inserted with a procedure as described in ......  
In contrast to other synthetic benchmarks, the introduced anomalies are for the human eye very hard to distinguish from the normal (chaotic) behavior. 

The labeled data can be found in the CSV files [1-10].csv
